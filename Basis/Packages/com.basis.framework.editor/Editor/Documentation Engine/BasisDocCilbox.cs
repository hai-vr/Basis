// Editor/Documentation Engine/BasisDocCilbox.cs
// The API reference's opening into the Cilbox sandbox.
//
// The doc engine knows nothing about Cilbox and must keep working when com.basis.shim is not in
// the project, so the answer is supplied from outside: the shim package registers a provider at
// editor load and the reference asks it per member. Nothing here decides what is allowed — the
// provider calls the sandboxes' own check methods, so the reference cannot drift from the rules.
