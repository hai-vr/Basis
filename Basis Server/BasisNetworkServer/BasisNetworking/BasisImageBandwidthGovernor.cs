    /// the *decision* — only the sharer knows how its fan-out splits between relayed and direct
    /// peers — but it is the wrong place for the *guarantee*, because a modified client simply
    /// ignores it and the original failure returns: one sharer saturating the server's egress and
    /// disconnecting everybody. Everything a client is asked to do politely needs a server-side
    /// floor under it, and <see cref="TryConsumeEgress"/> is that floor.
    ///
    /// The download direction has no client half at all. Cache replay is the server's own send to
    /// an arriving player who never requested it, so pacing it is not a backstop but the only
    /// control that exists.
    ///

    /// ends that transfer, and the recipients clean it up on their inbound timeout. That sounds

    /// server-side backlog this exists to prevent, turning an abusive client into an out-of-memory
